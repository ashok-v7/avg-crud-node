In YAML

Docker Compose file that defines two services, node_app and node_db

node_app service is used to build and run the Node.js application. It is built from the current directory (.)
node_app service is mapped to port 3000 on the host ,image is tagged with tknoptn/avg-node-crud , and depends on the node_db service.

node_db service is used to run the PostgreSQL database. It uses the postgres:12 image, listens on port 5432
node_db service uses a volume called node_db_data.
node_db_data volume is defined at the bottom of the file.

Docker Compose file sets up two services, one for the Node.js application and one for the PostgreSQL database, and connects them together. This allows the application to be run in a containerized environment, with all dependencies and configurations defined in the Compose file.
